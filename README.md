# The Band

my first project-2: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This is a website for a Music band called The monkees. This website shows: who they are, what they do,  where they perform,where you can find them,and some of their works.


## Demo
A live demo can be found [here] https://github.com/frankkode/my-first-project-2

![Desktop Demo](https://github.com/frankkode/my-first-project-2 "Desktop Demo")


## UX
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access the all activities and service this band can offer. The different color scheme was chosen to atract the viewer. 

For those who want to book , I  provided the place where they can pass direct and book easly  . They can read summery of how we do it, and experince we have in those activities,


## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.1.3)
4. fontawasome
5. w3school



## Features
This site uses the scrollSpy feature in Bootstrap with an extra JavaScript function added to create a 'smooth scrolling' effect and it brings some differences. The navbar also stays collapsed regardless of the screen size to promote a minimalist design.


### Features Left to Implement
In the future, I would like to add some album videos and audio . 


## Testing
if you click on tour-europe and tour-america the link will take you on other page where you can see the tour scedure and where you can buy a ticket.
In the about us section, you can read a bit about The band hystory, and if you are viewing on a desktop ,tablet or a phone, the background of this section is a photo of The Band member. you are able to see activities via bookings section . you can view both the live version and the GitHub repository by clicking on the Font Awesome icons. tou are also able to view their social media profiles via clicking on the icons in the footer. 

If you try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address. Furthermore, the 'required' attribute is added to the 'name,' 'email,' and 'message' fields, so if those fields are not filled in, the form will not submit. If all field are valid, the page will reload. If anyone is interested in contacting The band, you will have to fill out all fields in order for the form to go through.

the link will open in a form  All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.

By clicking on the links in the navbar, the link will take you on the title you are looking for,and some are listed when you click on  dropdown icon. 

This site was tested  Safari,and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 6,7,8, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. During the testing phase, I realized that "searching bar is not presantable on small device" therefor will be no searching bar on small device. 


## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page is "index.html".

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting "https://github.com/frankkode/my-first-project-2" into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.
